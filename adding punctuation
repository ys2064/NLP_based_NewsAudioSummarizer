##A dataset of 200 news audio files was collected from Reuters News and DW Newsâ€™ Youtube channel on which speech-to-text conversion was performed using SpeechRecognition library to obtain textual transcripts. 
These obtained textual files were then punctuated in order to define  sentence boundaries by using PunctuationModel from deepmultilingualpunctuation library.##


##This is the code to add punctuations to the text files##



from deepmultilingualpunctuation import PunctuationModel
import os

input_folder = '/content/drive/MyDrive/entire_dataset/' 
save_at_folder = '/content/drive/MyDrive/entire_dataset punctuation/'  

os.makedirs(save_at_folder, exist_ok=True)
model = PunctuationModel()
for filename in os.listdir(input_folder):
    if filename.endswith('.txt'): 
        input_file_path = os.path.join(input_folder, filename)
        with open(input_file_path, 'r') as file:
            transcription_text = file.read()
        punctuated_text = model.restore_punctuation(transcription_text)
        output_file_path = os.path.join(save_at_folder, filename)
        with open(output_file_path, 'w') as output_file:
            output_file.write(punctuated_text)
        print(f"Processed and saved: {filename}")
